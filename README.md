How does my not documenting time and tasks become bothersome, how can I make it obvious enough? Analytics are one way, and huge.
Database needs to have a simple transaction record with all LifeTracker events in it.

Can I somehow make the feeling of not updating upsetting --- making it a part of who I am -- making it part of my day to day.
I need to be addicted to documenting in this program, almost like a video game, how do video games become addictive..... 
scoring points and defeating foes

I need to make a MUD out of this... something just random and fun, dungeons, treasures, saved princesses, bosses, 
not a crafted story a random series of missions. This could be something I journal about. 

I need to incentivize learning more things by video and reading, think back to physics, astronomy, jets, I need to be that person again.
Finding inefficiencies in my day will be massively useful, particularly over long chunks of time.

My database will need to quickly stabalize or I will need to do more migrations as I move data from class change to class change.

Collectables are incentive to play a game, you could find parts to armor and weapons or something?
